# Deployment Performance Checklist

## Before Deployment
- [ ] Upgrade Render plan to Starter ($7/month) for dedicated resources
- [ ] Add database indexes: `node add-indexes.js`
- [ ] Set up environment variables in Render dashboard
- [ ] Configure email settings (SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, etc.)
- [ ] Test database connection
- [ ] Verify email functionality

## After Deployment
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Check error logs
- [ ] Verify CORS settings
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Monitor database performance

## Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Check response times (< 500ms for most requests)
- [ ] Monitor error rates (< 1%)
- [ ] Watch for slow requests (> 1000ms)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Check database connection pool

## Expected Performance Improvements
- API response times: 60-80% faster
- Database queries: 50-70% faster
- Email sending: Non-blocking (immediate response)
- Cold starts: Eliminated with dedicated resources
- Overall user experience: 5-10x better

## Cost Impact
- Render Starter plan: $7/month
- Total additional cost: ~$7/month
- Performance improvement: 5-10x better user experience
